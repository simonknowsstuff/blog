    Hey, hello!
   </h2>
   <p>
    Hello! My name's simonknowsstuff and this blog is about stuff I find interesting from tech to science, or even stuff I don't really know a lot about like cooking! I will probably post almost once in a week depending on the amount of free time I have.

   <h2>
    Tell us a bit more about yourself.
   </h2>
   <p>
    I'm a high school student, creating stuff and interested about computers and technology as a whole.

   <h2>
    Why was this blog made?
   </h2>
   <p>
    Good question. Frankly, I have no idea. I think it has to do more with testing my code for a blog generator I made in python rather than actually wanting one, which I'll write a post about on in detail later on! :D
   </p>
   <h2>
    Where can I contact you aside from these blog posts?
   </h2>
   <p>
    Shoot me an email over at simonknowsstuff@gmail.com! I may be slow to respond as it is less than common I check my email. I will try to respond as fast as possible though :)
